# Overview
My team and I attempted to predict an FBS college football team's success based on turnover margin, penalties, and conference rank. We did this using multiple linear regression methodology. Using R, we cleaned and prepared a large set of data from the 2022 college football season. In this project, we wrote a "DataAppendix" quarto markdown document, which cleaned the data, and a "TechnicalReport" quarto markdown document, which produced a detailed technical write-up of our findings, using typical academic research methodology. The impact of this project was predicting team's success, which might educate coaches and fans on which teams are more likely to have success and why.

# Project Guidelines
In Applied Regression Analysis, we were required to put linear regression techniques into practice, by coming up with a project idea, finding and cleaning the data, formulating a hypothesis, conducting the analysis, and then writing up our findings. This technical report involved writing professionally, as it was very similar to an academic research project. Quarto markdown documents were the method of manipulating data and writing findings.
